  <li>Hamming Correction</li>
  <li>Chisquare
    <ul>
      <li>Chisquare-RunTest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Linear Congruential Algoritm</li>
  <li>meanProducts
    <ul>
      <li>meanProduct with ChiSquare</li>
      <li>meanSquares</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multiplative ongruential ALgorithm</li>
</ul>
Hamming Correction
==================
Basically int this 3 Pictures we will see a small background about how Hamming correction works
it is used in Physical layer  to transmit data, that data need to be like encrypted with a pattern 
that allow to receiver adapter check if a signal has any erro in the message\n
[Transmiting message]\n
this image show how a message is transmitted by bits

those bits are coded with a pattern

this script made in python allows correct a message of 7 bits long with 3 correction bits
Hamming 7,3
